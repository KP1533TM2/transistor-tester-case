# transistor-tester-case

This is a case I've made for "vanvell ELC" transistor tester I've got off eBay (for example, http://www.ebay.com/itm/271819154888). I did it so I could safely take with me somewhere in a bag and not crush it.

The code is ugly (but hey, it works :)), because this is also my very first experience with OpenSCAD :)

I've tried to add some artwork inside the case, but the plastic I've printed turned out to be not translucent enough for it to show through the cover.
