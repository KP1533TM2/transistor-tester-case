# transistor-tester-case

This is a case I've made for "vanvell ELC" transistor tester I've got off eBay (for example, http://www.ebay.com/itm/271819154888). I did it so I could safely take with me somewhere in a bag and not crush it.

The code is ugly (but hey, it works :)), because this is also my very first experience with OpenSCAD :)

I've tried to add some artwork inside the case, but the plastic I've printed turned out to be not translucent enough for it to show through the cover.

Maybe I'll post it on thingiverse (or somewhere like that) later...
